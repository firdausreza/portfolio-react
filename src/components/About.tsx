				Hi! My name is Reza, people also call me Ali. I live in
				Indonesia and I graduated from Bachelor Degree of Informatics at
				Islamic University of Indonesia. I remember when I became
				interested in programming and application development, it was
				while studying web development course in college. For me,
				programming itself is quite unique and it can grind our
				creativity in problem solving.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				I'm a <strong className="text-sky">Web Development</strong> enthusiast,
				a lifelong learner who always had the curiosity to learn web technologies.
				Currently I'm building a career as Frontend Developer, and so far
				I had 2 years of professional experiences. I have a dream to become
				a Fullstack Developer and a good leader in Web Development.
				<br/>
				<br/>I had my first professional experiences by doing an
				internship at{" "}

						Jala Tech
					</a>
				</span>{" "}
				for 6 months and got another extra 3-months of part-time
				opportunity. I landed my first internship as Product Engineer
				but focused as Front End Developer. I learned so many new things
				in either the hard skills and soft skills, like professional
				working ethics, learned how to adapt in new environment, learned
				new tech stacks used for web development, etc. And so far, I'm experienced
				in Frontend Development for 2 years, specialized in using <strong className="text-sky">Vue </strong>
				and <strong className="text-sky">React</strong> technologies. But I had proven work
				experiences using <strong className="text-sky">Vue</strong> and <strong
					className="text-sky">Angular </strong>
				technologies. I remember my notable works are developed Telegram
				Bot for Jala Tech to support local shrimp farmers, and assisted Kompas
				Gramediaâ€™s SEO team to conduct Google Analytics migration and implemented
				analytics tracking.
				<br/>

				hear your ideas and we can make it happen together!
